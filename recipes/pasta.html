        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This dish <em>had me</em> at fresh tomatoes, spinach, and garlic! Add some perfectly roasted chicken breast, stringy mozzarella cheese, and pasta; and you’ve got a meal everyone will devour. This Rigatoni di Spago recipe may use super simple ingredients and preparation but, the results <em>are incredible</em>. It’s light but uncompromising in flavor with the rich tomato umami. <strong>A true pasta gem!</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you’re a garlic lover, definitely use more in this dish! I’m a sucker for garlic and tomato, so I usually use more than the ingredients list specifies.</li>
                <li>It takes a minute or two to incorporate the cheese. I know it seems like all the cheese wants to clump together, but I just use two forks to separate the biggest ones.</li>
                <li>This dish would also be incredible with gnocchi instead of rigatoni.</li>
                <li>Depending on how much time you have, you could blanch and peel the tomatoes beforehand. This is totally optional though.</li>
                <li>If you’re in a pinch, you could definitely use frozen spinach for this recipe, but I would suggest trying to find fresh spinach.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound chicken breast</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper</li>
                <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 shallot, finely chopped</li>
                <li>8 ounces spinach</li>
                <li>2 large tomatoes, cut into large chunks</li>
                <li>*or 1 ½ cup of cherry tomatoes</li>
                <li>1 ½ cup mozzarella balls</li>
                <li>1 pound rigatoni pasta</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>A few leaves of fresh basil, chiffonaded</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F.</li>
                <li>Season the chicken breast with salt and pepper to taste on both sides. Set aside. </li>
                <li>In an ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, place 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of olive oil. When hot, carefully place in the chicken breast and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes. Repeat with the other side. </li>
                <li>When adequately browned, place into the oven to finish cooking for 20-25 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F. Set aside for at least 10 minutes before slicing into thin strips. </li>
                <li>In the meantime, while the chicken is cooking, bring a large pot of water to boil for the pasta. Heavily salt the water once it’s boiling. </li>
                <li>Cook pasta based on instructions--usually 8-10 minutes. </li>
                <li>In a large pan over medium-low heat, drizzle in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil. When hot, toss in the garlic and shallots and let it cook/infuse for a few minutes until fragrant and softened. </li>
                <li>Turn the heat up to medium and toss in the tomatoes. Let this cook down for 3-5 minutes and fold in the spinach. Let everything cook together for 2-3 minutes, or until the spinach has wilted. Turn off the heat and add in the chicken. </li>
                <li>In the same pan or in a large bowl, combine everything with the mozzarella, and toss until the cheese is evenly dispersed and stringy (‘spago’ means string in Italian). This may take a minute, but it's worth the extra couple seconds!</li>
                <li>Feel free to add a little pasta water if you need to thin the sauce out. Garnish with the chiffonaded basil.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
